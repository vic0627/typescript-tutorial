# Creational Patterns (創建型模式)

Creational Patterns focus on object creation mechanisms, providing ways to create objects in a flexible and reusable manner. They abstract the process of object creation and hide the specific details of how objects are instantiated.

## Examples of Creational Patterns

- Singleton pattern (單例模式)
- Factory Method (工廠方法)
- Abstract Factory (抽象工廠)
- Builder (生成器)
- Prototype (原型)
